# NMF-Analysis-Visualization on `Song-drafts` Branch

## Description
This branch serves as a temporary storage for Jupyter notebooks related to Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) analysis and visualization. These notebooks are currently in draft form and originate from the `/net/seq/data2/projects/aabisheva/Encode/my_ipynb` directory.

> **Last Updated**: October 27, 2023

## Current Status
As of October 27, 2023, all relevant notebooks have been copied from `/net/seq/data2/projects/aabisheva/Encode/my_ipynb` to this branch. The notebook `pipeline_results_presenting.ipynb` was excluded due to its large size.

## Goals and Plans

### Short-Term
- Refactor code for better readability and maintainability.
- Include inline comments and docstrings for functions and code blocks.

### Mid-Term
- Debug all functions in the notebooks to ensure they are working as intended.
- Create a separate directory for polished, debugged functions.

### Long-Term
- Prepare a branch with fully debugged functions, complete with documentation and descriptions.
- The long-term aim is to publish this set of code snippets and functions as supplementary materials for our research article.

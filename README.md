# NMF-Analysis-Visualization Repository

## Description
This repository serves as a codebase for Jupyter notebooks and scripts focused on the analysis of results and visualization of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method applied to our ENCODE project. It is intended to eventually provide supplementary materials for our research article.

## Branches in this Repository

### `main`
- **Purpose**: The `main` branch serves as the primary branch where polished and fully debugged code snippets, functions, and notebooks are merged.
- **Status**: Under development.

### `Song-drafts`
- **Purpose**: The `Song-drafts` branch is a temporary storage for draft Jupyter notebooks and scripts. These are not yet polished and are primarily for backup and internal review.
- **Status**: Active, last updated on October 27, 2023. For more details, see the README in the `Song-drafts` branch.

## Goals and Plans

### Short-Term
- Consolidate all related code and notebooks from different sources.
- Refactor and debug code for public consumption.

### Mid-Term
- Separate polished, debugged functions into their own directories with accompanying documentation.
- Begin draft of research article using findings from codebase.

### Long-Term
- Complete the research article and submit for publication.
- Release the supplementary code as a package or repository alongside the published article.
